# TotallyNotMonopoly

_This is a game very similar to the popular Monopoly board game. In our case we will have a board where the players will try to get rich and at least not reach the bankruptcy._

## The Game 🎲💸🏠
In our game we have a board with squares with emblematic places of Budapest. The players (4) will go around the board buying properties or paying rents to the owners of the properties.
On the board, players can obtain fortune cards that can upgrade or downgrade them.
In our game we will also have a prison, where the player will be detained for some turns without being able to play.
In one of the corners of the board we have the "GO" where the player will receive money every time he passes by.

## Project 💻
For TotallyNotMonopoly we have made a division in frontend and backend, where the frontend was developed wiht Angular (TypeScript) and the backend with C#
